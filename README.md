Have you ever tried to have a conversation with someone at a restaurant where the other person is watching 'the big game' on the TV behind you?



Well, what if you could turn off that TV. And while you are at it, what if you could turn off all the other TV's in the room with the press of one button. REGARDLESS OF THE BRAND OF TV!



The TV-B-Gone is a universal off-button for TVs. It has an outstanding 150 foot reach and can turn off more than 300 brands of TVs.
